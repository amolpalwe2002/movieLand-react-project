Welcome to Movieland! üé¨üçø

Movieland is a React application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API and displays relevant information such as the movie title, poster, and year of release. This project is a practical example of using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, along with async-await for handling asynchronous API calls.
